When Sergej called yesterday, I almost didn’t pick up. I guess he must have forgot that he pressed ‘call’, because after two minutes it was still ringing. He had every reason to be angry: Even if he had hidden his departure from me until the last minute, my childish vengeance on the virtual supermarket he built up in endless hours of playing Bank Holiday was beyond excuse. The repeating marimba cadence of the call’s ring implied a passive aggression only inanimate systems are capable of conveying. I must have felt in need of a final dispute to confirm our estrangement, otherwise why would I have picked up after the twentieth ring. 

“Hi.” He made a sound as if it had been me calling him, as if I had barged in in the middle of something.

“How was the flight?”

“Okay. They gave us the congresspeople’s meal.”

“What’s that?”

“Sauerkraut and Würstchen.” Was he making jokes about an event so serious?

“So everything’s fine or what?” My response sounded sulky as I heard it coming out.

“Sure.”

…

“Wanna play?”

“What?”

“Duh!”

“Bank Holiday?” I was having trouble bringing myself to pronounce the title.

“Mom got me an account. But she said I was only allowed to play with you. And I’m on another patch of the city.” He must have known. There was simply no way he didn’t check on his supermarket. Still I lied, made a final attempt at causing the ultimate falling out that I had been picking up for.

“They demolished your supermarket.” It was a lie too easy to spot. Sergej’s store was built on the original plot that had been assigned to his account. Anyone but Michael or Sergej itself could have destroyed what had been constructed there.
