On November 11th, 1989, in the early morning hours a tiny tadpole poked into your ovum like you would stick a clove into an orange so it would give off a scent of summer and christmas alike, of home.

At dawn, you left the F1 to pass water and smoke, to rest a minute from the Fernstraße still busy with day-trippers, coming and going, veering and honking exuberantly. You ripped through the skins of first frost on the puddles, running for the bushes. Only as you returned to the car you noticed the silence of the animals and the land, listening to the drone of the horns blending into each other. The incessant choir of 3 million voices from FER Ruhla made the earth reverberate and soothed the rush of hormones during my first hours inside you. 
You expected trouble to await you. Not only had you been out all night, but also had you lost Katrin, likely resulting in a phone call between parents, and when had that ever helped. 
I had always assumed your parents would scream when they were angry. To scream, yell, and rage like you did. Like you wou.with me many years later, when you would find me outside sitting on the neighbor’s balcony rail, from where I could spot the sea on clear days. The neighboring apartment had been the scene of a crime the news had covered to an extent that we felt it had been us calling the authorities over the smell leaking from under the cracked rubber seal into the corridor. Actually we had only moved in when the horror had ceased to even make the regional columns of the tabloids you didn’t want me to pick up, but the refurbishment the owner of the apartment was willing to afford failed to stop the sepulchral odors and eerie tales from permeating the adjacent walls. The apartment itself repelled me even more than it did the visitors, whom the pitiful owner tried to get interested in the cherry glaze kitchen and the travertine vinyl sheet flooring with increasing desperation. But its balcony, opening up towards the undeveloped plots beyond the main road, with the north-facing unit dark enough to disappear from view behind the reflection in the door on bright days, became my beloved retreat. I had discovered the outlook shutting up Robert, who had dared me to make the jump from our parapet to the neighbor’s. The block’s units were too tightly packed to render leaping between balconies an athletic challenge, though the nine meter drop posed one of a different kind and the rectangular tiles of the siding gave the abyss a foreshortened [word for “dramaticness”]. My head buzzed with adrenaline and my chest hurt from the impact on the rail, having gauged the leap to be further, but the sudden eastern gust as I turned the corner of the balcony and the unobstructed perspective, that felt as if my view had unfolded from academy to cinemascope, sounded a consonance in me that made me forget to double dare Robert and had me return to the block’s bowsprit when I was in need for quiet and solitude. As the only balcony facing north on our floor, it offered a precious calm, rare to find in the complex. Behind the parapet I could sit like a half-hidden sentry overlooking the coming and going on the complex's driveway. As I got older and my light-footed crossings stopped yielding their initial tingle I proceeded to sit on the rail spinning strands of spit to drop on the passersby below. Sometimes you would put up with the detour around the block so you could spot me from the driveway and cause me the embarrassment of having you yell up at me across four floors. Though I think you saw where I was coming from, after all, you appreciated the elusive solitude as much as I did. Then again, you had to make your point, and so you yelled, you screamed, you raged.
I had to discover that your parents were different in that regard. Never did I witness Opa betray his soft-spoken demeanor. He passed on his reclusiveness to both of us, although his genome found an appropriate counterbalance in Oma’s. Opa knew three different jokes, which he immediately told every person he was introduced to, so he could decide that he had proven himself sociable enough to dispense with the need for more than an acknowledging mutter when they would cross paths again. The few times I met him before my 13th birthday, he proceeded with me along the same protocol, and it surprises me that I can only remember one from his repertoire, the one with Honecker and the GENEX delivery person. Being a teenager, I suppose I was deemed beyond jokes, however, he continued to regale me with an abundance of sweets that proved much more harmful than the old chestnuts to my hormone-lined self, and an attention that he rarely bestowed upon anyone else. That time I got upset about his birthday present belying my expectations and told him nobody cared whether he even came around next year, he exercised his punishment through silent indignation and disappointment. His gift was a Canon PowerShot A5, he left me at the kitchen table, confused, remorse welling up inside me.
Oma worked for the VEB Autobahnkombinat and had adjusted her voice to prevail against the constant noise of construction and passing two-stroke engines. 

(On toggling clipping in Oblivion) Any confinement removed but condemned to never again be part of something intimate, always transcending. Stripped of any illusion of a room’s shelter it used to give me the uncanny feeling of awakening in my bed in the middle of a deserted fairground hall.

A low rasp invades the corny ballad, travelling along the cable of Michaels noise cancelling headphones. Michael likes his beard short and sturdy. It would support a car’s weight, uniform weight distribution provided. Snap out and into the please-exercise-discretion-gap. - Any news about my son’s luggage? - (Ay! There’s a line here!) - My colleague will be with you shortly, sir - replies and adds a count to the “assholes” column of her personal customer satisfaction statistics. Back to leap distance, back to airy piano and pondering the impending indefinite extension of his son’s holiday visit. Neither welcome nor adverse, inconvenient but certainly the more responsible option. 
Malignant glances from the front of the line. Further back the limp and dazed from waiting times making the two digit counter over the check-in desk overrun cannot help but smirk at Michael’s chutzpah. The end of the line is out of sight. 
This will take a while, Michael, retrieving some mistakenly checked luggage is going to be the least of their worries. He takes out his phone to survey a game Sergej has been wanting to play for days. “Bank Holiday”, Michael skims some reviews, critics raving. The download is within JFK’s Fast-Free-plan. Here’s Sergej to explain why Bank Holiday is great.
“So, Bank Holiday is really great because, it’s like Fortnite, but it’s way more complex and complicated and there’s not so many annoying quitters and it’s also much harder to win, because you know, you can’t actually buy just some super powerful weapon, or some...some item that makes you super strong but you have to work for it, and...there’s also much more freedom, like you start just like a normal battle royal, but then you figure out that you can also build something and do something together and join in JVs and there’s so much going on over your head...and you have to cor…”, “collaborate?”, “...yes you have to collaborate much more because as...as you know the saying goes, if you’re moving forward together, then success will take care of itself”.
Michael’s battery dies. His headphones’ keep bracketing his head in a private prayer room. This should have happened earlier, he thinks. Admittedly, he regrets the thought, immediately. Helen had called half an hour ago, suggesting Sergej should stay in New York, seeing that schools would stay closed and air travel is justifiably advised against. Michael promptly got his guard up, hands twitching as the cane comes down, but then realized that he did not have any objections, at least of the kind he could bring up opposite her. You should be happy to spend time with your son.
He is happy, partly because another clerk peeks out from the backroom behind the check in, leaving an object that might as well be the long-awaited luggage next to the door. The employee at the desk looks up at him furtively, just long enough to make it clear that she will decisively not beckon him over but leave it to him to confront the pent-up anger of the line. Excuse me! - Most certainly a teacher, quick to get in between Michael and the counter, authoritative and loud, sure to immortalize her accusal, austere but fair, on the CCTV recordings for potential later review. Naturally any interference from the far side of the check-in desk is not to be expected. With the reach of the air rage videos he is about to become the subject of weighed against the expected waiting time, he grimly trudges towards the end of the line.
The east german airline Interflug was founded on September 18th, 1958. Its matchbox labels in the colors of the imperialist enemy filled Heinrich’s scrapbook and its in-flight-magazine still trusted its readers with the technicalities of turboprop aviation. In December 1959 Heinrich’s father Adam, a pilot for Lufthansa on his part, received a stately letter from his brother, who sent his warmest Christmas wishes (...give my heartfelt thanks to Barbara for the delicious christmas biscuits she sent…), and it wasn’t the mentioning of his freshly estranged first wife that got him upset but rather the audacity of his brother’s handwritten addition to the company logo in the letterhead - fly the original. The eastern of the two Germanies had founded the second Lufthansa about a year after its West German competitor had registered the trademark and quickly found itself in an intellectual property lawsuit that hardly fit the concept of the workers’ and peasants’ state. Ignorant of the juridical cogency of his employer’s case and eager to rebut the characteristic conceit of his brother, Adam requested his own stationary (Deutsche Lufthansa: Safely landing for peasants and nobles alike - a cynical play on the recent crash of Flight 502 that had claimed the life of Archduchess Maria Ileana of Austria-Este) that was granted to him surprisingly swift after he stated his patriotic reason. 
Michael has reached the beginning of the waiting line’s guide system.
With the sixties came sheepish preparations for the end of the East German Lufthansa. But even when Adam discovered the Interflug decals for a quick rebranding in case of emergencies, he continued his fierce exchange of letters and stationaries with increasing fury. On September 1st, 1963, Barbara remarried, a doctor of science specializing in the use of nuclear power in aircraft engines (“On a 24 hour non-stop flight, an aircraft with a motor capacity of 50,000 HP would use about 50g of uranium-235”), the East German Lufthansa was liquidated in favor of consolidating all air traffic of the Democratic Republic in the Interflug, and Adam posted his venomous last letter to his brother, wishing him and his Fork-tongued Revisionist Government to hell. 
By the first turn of the line, the collective drowsiness has infected Michael, drowning out any residual anger. 
By June, 1964, Adam had long made peace with the red and white replacement carrier. Mother ZentrAv, busy putting idle hands and heads to work, had quickly reassigned him as a pilot to the one remaining airline, Interflug. He flew local services, Barth, Heringsdorf, Karl-Marx-Stadt, back in time for dinner with his son, Thursdays with the housekeeper joining to play house. Heinrich had traded his matchbox labels for tickets to the Sputniks, stayed out late, two hours of sleep, took a nap out on the lawn chair after school and woke up twenty hours later in his bed with a barf bucket next to him under the tired eyes of his father, haggard from a night watching his son fall in and out of violent convulsions.
A dog is leashed to the post of the guide system. Michael wonders whether the unattended luggage policy applies to animate baggage, too.
Terezia was fluent in German, Hungarian, Russian, and Greek. She had basic knowledge of French, Spanish and Italian, and managed to pronounce the prewritten English announcements decently enough once she had transcribed their pronunciation into her own elaborate phonetic notation. We are very sorry that our flight because of heavy turbulence rather rough (sic). The pilot on the flight to Conakry was surly and strangely overdimensioned in his build, that it seemed like a cork was jammed into the cabin when he came out of the cockpit. She treated him to a drink. He said he was Adam. She loved him but also the peace of mind their marriage meant for her. 
Two more turns to go.
Then, Wanda was born. Adam showered her with gifts, love, and indulgence. In 1979, nine years, seventeen baby teeth, she owned fifteen copies of Interflug’s in-flight coloring book, the twenty-four-piece jigsaw puzzle of an IL-62 cockpit, and a custom-made suitcase covered with every sticker issued since 1958, twelve alone of her favored mermaid design. Having exhausted the company gift shop, Adam brought her dolls from Leningrad, watermelons from Odessa, and premature perfume from Damascus. For her tenth birthday, he asked a colleague to bring an Atari 2600 from Rome. Adam’s brother haunted him even from behind the barrier of silence Adam had erected between them, and as meticulously as his renunciation of his last familial tie to the capitalist elsewhere was documented on custom-printed corporate stationary, regulations were all too clear to grant him any assignment to non-socialist destinations. 
Businesswoman in coral blazer, family of five, sinister broker, then Michael.
In the afternoon of November 9th, 1989, a funeral party was heading through persistent drizzle towards the chapel of the Cracauer cemetery. Terezia had hardly known Barbara but had managed to wrap what Adam had told her - life events recited in the manner of maintenance procedures - in emotional prose. Adam had been lying to Terezia, he would have to read the eulogy at sight. He was feeling sick and embarrassed he noticed that his Privileg aftershave barely covered the stench of cold sweat. Not everybody felt as warmly about his presence as Barbara would have (or rather did, remembering his catholic roots), as the scattered groups among the pews confirmed. His successor, professor emeritus (“It is indeed conceivable that our general secretary will mark our nation’s 30th anniversary on an atomic flight around the globe.”), had abandoned his air of sufferance after Adam’s allusion to his earlier research. Adam’s voice trembled but he had made it all the way to Barbara holding Wanda on her first ride with the training wheels off. Barbara slipping her hands off the shoulders of the accelerating child, Wanda panicking as she noticed the missing guidance but keeping her heading, swerving but still going. That’s where he lost it. Adam tried to reestablish contact with the text, to Barbara  and Wanda, but his thoughts bounced off of each other like the neutrons in professor emeritus’s reactor cores. Someone was asking a question. Adam didn’t hear, didn’t see - Heinrich, get him out to get some air, right now, immediately. The organist played Bach as Adam watched the exiting mourners pass him.
He will not make the two-hour trip to 181st on an empty battery. $3 is worth the entertainment and he gets a decaf coffee with it. All seats are taken but a socket has gone unnoticed behind a partition wall. The baristas are making a killing with everyone needing a drink (chamomile, mainly) as Michael waits for his phone to gather emergency reserves. He wants to throw on a bib and join them, be part of the thrill of crisis without being seriously affected. 
On the train to Harlem, Michael organizes the upcoming weeks. Tomorrow he has a good workday length between breakfast and the inevitable nightshift to finish Monday morning’s blog article, and he intends to make up for the little time spent with Sergej throughout the last week. 
On the town, the two of them, starfish shaped itinerary across the city’s map. Though it’s almost certain that his son has never been to of laser tag arena, the hope for a reconciliatory esprit de corps as well as the amusing thought of the dismay at Sergej’s first-headshot achievement badge on his return to the old country convinced Michael, when Akash proposed to take the kids tomorrow. The arena is located in a raw warehouse in Queens that would have reminded Michael of teenage Counter-Strike matches on de_nuke with his friend Juan, had it not been painted with thick layers of neon-coloured rust-proofing paint. This is tomorrow, possibly also next Sunday, provided he can win Sergej over. 
Audible rolling of eyes from the local commuters as a busker boards the car, more so when they realize it’s a sax. His speaker cart does nothing to support him as it proceeds to accompany him asthmatically. Who knows why Michael still fumbles for change, probably the musician hit a soft spot with him, and doesn’t the thin voice of the instrument over the subway rumbling sound like the high-pass wood samples of Michael’s workout playlist? When the sax player has finished and passes through the aisle he claims high fives left and right with his bounty - Michael thinks of neutrons and doesn’t know why.
Monday still poses a challenge to be addressed at a later point.
....
On the first attempt he misses the keyhole, clumsily dropping the key on the bare hardwood floor, the noise reminding him to buy that doormat for keeping out the sand that sticks around the sidewalks for weeks after the last snow. If sand theft is only half the problem last week’s true crime feature made it sound like, smugglers should look into the streets of uptown New York instead of the banks of the Yangtze river. But it’s not the jangle of the keys that makes Michael go off. Slow down the tempo a moment. As the keys hit the floor, Sergej, being already in a state of utter annoyance in the face of the most recent displays of his father’s shortcomings, reacts with an expression that would be transcribed by linguists as “ | x “, a pipe character - Michael got to know it writing technical documentation and recalls it as a symbol of union - describing the sound of forcefully pulling the tongue back from the incisors, followed by a prolonged voiceless velar fricative, exhaling with a narrowed throat passage as familiar to yogis from the meditational ujjayi breath.
He kicks the door with the explosive force of pent up frustration breaking its way. The lowest door panel breaks from its frame, trapping its assailant for a second, sending him stumbling back into his son. The triangular hole casts a ray of light along the corridor that Sergej follows to his room while his father feigns to examine the damage, furtively scrutinizing his foot, that is starting to complain painfully as the rush of adrenaline is subsiding. Tomorrow morning the Italians downstairs will wake them with the tangy scents of early morning preparations for sunday’s family meal. Michael decides that the door can’t be helped at this point of the evening. If he’s lucky, the orphaned sheet iron next to the building entrance has not yet been picked up. Despite the cries of his second toe, Michael passes the kitchen with the deep sea blue pack of cooling liquid in the freezer, determined to live down the matter the sooner the better. Several thousand pieces of Lego, a composite collection from recent christmas presents and Michael’s own childhood sets that he had schlepped from one self-storage to the next both out of parsimony and joyful anticipation of paternal nostalgia, orbit Sergej, who is busying himself prying two-by-four tiles from a plate. Michael joins him among the bricks, scanning the dull pre-millennial plastic dotted with the teal fragments of the statue of liberty, a complicit attempt of his ex-sister-in-law to get Sergej excited about the city. He offers his son a brick separator, but Sergej only hunches deeper over his work, pushing his nails beneath the plates.


Napkin Synopsis

Michael is conceived in a delirious affair on the night of the fall of the Berlin wall. His mother Wanda, an 18-year-old East German, the child of two engineers, flees on a tourist visa from the wrath of her parents to her uncle in the US. The family of her uncle learns about the impending birth just upon her arrival and shows little in terms of enthusiasm. They put her up in their home in Santa Clarita, She gives birth to Michael on August 4th, 1990. Shortly after she is presented with a five-figure hospital bill. Running from her debts, she returns with Michael to what is now East Germany. Michaels mother cares for her child but the trouble his birth caused her provides the foundation for a difficult relationship that leads to increased estrangement and finally a breaking off of all contact.

30 years later, Michael has returned to the US, working as a software developer in New York. Like his mother's, his young adulthood has been marked by premature parenthood. His relationship from his days studying Applied Informatics in Hildesheim lasted just long enough to get an abortion off the table. His ten-year-old son Sergej, called Gigi, lives with his mother in Germany but visits Michael during school holidays. Michael loves his son and regrets putting an ocean’s distance between them. Though when Sergej is with him, he has trouble relating to the child and mostly leaves Sergej to play by himself. When schools are being closed down because of Corona, Michael decides to keep Sergej safe with him in New York. Two weeks later, New York is on lockdown. Home with Sergej, Michael sleeps late and spends his nights working and watching the hospital across the street from his window and on nightly walks when Sergej is asleep. Stuck in Michael’s small apartment, father and son fight frequently and passionately. After walking out on Sergej in the middle of a fight, Michael finds his son running after him, crying. He consoles his son and takes him on one of his nightly walks. The promenade proves to be a welcome distraction for Sergej, too, and helps to relieve the tension between them. Michael begins to reenact the stealth games he and Sergej play at home throughout their nightly walks. While Michael had been bored playing video games with his son he and Sergej develop a shared passion for their nighty escape fictions. Michael becomes increasingly ambitious and concerts extensive reenactments of various historic escape scenarios. Only when Michael tries to reenact the flight across the Berlin wall do they become disenchanted. Sergej out of frustration because Michael ruins their game, overdirecting it and “making it boring”. In Michael, it stirs up memories.

Even though their relationship evolves to be anything but harmonious, the situation creates a conflictual intimacy that helps Michael to relate to his son as well as to his own mother.
When Sergej is set to return home, Michael decides to join his son on his trip to Germany in order to visit his Mother. He writes a letter to her recapitulating her life during the time of her pregnancy.


Structure

Michael’s conception. The night of the fall of the Berlin wall.

Michael is at the airport checking in Sergej’s luggage in the evening before his flight back to Germany. Sergej’s mother calls Michael, asking him to keep their son with him for a couple of weeks. Schools are about to close and the pandemic is on the rise in Germany. Michael initially makes some half-hearted attempts at convincing Sergej’s mother of letting their son return, but eventually agrees that it would be best if Sergej stayed with him at least for another week. When Michael informs Sergej, he shows neither disappointment nor enthusiasm.

Wanda and her parents, both successful engineers. Her father works at the Ministry of Housing and Urban Development, her mother at the VEB Autobahnbaukombinat. Both are in deep concern about the political developments. Michael writes about some mundane or semi-historical event in November 1989 in his mother’s life.

Michael works from home, as he has been frequently doing in the past. He is working as a software developer in natural language generation. Sergej has met the neighbor girl in the hall (“Nice shirt. What’s your tag?” - “sergb01”) and spends his time playing Fortnight. Michael is stressed by the spreading panic and gets into a heated argument at the store when he checks out with his stacked shopping cart of supplies for the next two weeks. Sergej goes on agitated about the irate customer arguing with Michael, until Michael snubs Sergej, feeling patronized by his partisanship, telling him that the other was right after all. Rueful Michael cooks dinner for them and plays video games with Sergej, though his attention and goodwill subside soon. 
The next day, Michael prepares an ample breakfast for them but has to rush through it in order to join a teleconference. The following days they go about their routine, go shopping, call Sergej’s mother, follow the news, culminating in the annunciation of the lockdown.

It’s early December 1989 and Wanda’s period is late. 

Michael

Wanda moved out of her parents’ apartment and is living with a friend in Potsdam. She forms the idea of going to the US. She wants to see the country and maybe stay there. She has an uncle in Valencia, CA and writes to him. It’s January 1990.

Themes

Two historical events are featured. The Reunification and the Covid pandemic. Both historical events are followed accurately but merely provide a backdrop or context. 

Michael writes in his letter about the chronology of his mother’s flight to the US and back but also looks back at the relationship between him and his mother in his own childhood. It should not be obvious where he spent that childhood until his account of his mother’s travels catch up.

Styles

Michael writes in a poetic, romantic fashion. He often uses comparisons and metaphors. He sticks to a traditional understanding of style and structure. In telling his mother’s story he uses the chronology of her pregnancy as well as that of the German reunification as a basic structure and proceeds and digresses along emotional associations diachronically. He rarely reflects on his own writing in his text. His letter has a rather solemn feel, but draws up spaces humble but warm, densely populated by people in continuous interaction. Humorous remarks are limited to circumstantial observations about secondary characters.

The narrator of Michael’s storyline is not particularly fond of Michael. He deems him egocentric, spoilt and lugubrious. Occasionally, he seems to be harder on Michael than he deserves. While Michaels writing focuses on emotional, non-visible aspects, the narrator writes in a descriptive, almost cinematic fashion. Relationships are characterized through dialog, and less through descriptions of their feelings.
